<p style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 18px; padding: 12px; margin: px;" align="justify"><strong> My project in 4th year is about the clustering of servers in a business and how clustering can protect against disasters and failures in the business and how it is the solution to near-complete reliable redundancy in a network. How I came across this idea is from a class I had in my course where my lecturer shared some topic ideas for the project this year and it stood out to me, so I proceeded to research this topic more as it interested me, and I was not disappointed. I did have other ideas like virtualization, authentication, security, or database software for the server side of the cloud. I am a datacentre operations student. We focus more on the server side and administration side of the cloud in computing. So, the project had to be a cloud-based infrastructure for small to large businesses or datacentres. Clustering seemed like an interesting topic to research, and it wasn&rsquo;t covered much in my classes so I wanted to know more about clustering and what it is and how it works and how can it be an important feature for businesses. </strong></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is Server Clustering?</span></h2>
<p style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 18px; padding: 12px; margin: x;" align="justify"><strong> Server clustering provides a measure for near-complete reliable redundancy and the highest level of availability for mission-critical applications with the options of scalability and load balancing. Clustering has three different types of models and refers to how servers manage in the cluster. Failover clustering allows multiple servers to work together to provide high availability which is a part of the technology feature that clustering provides to help designed businesses meet their availability and uptime goals. This feature provides protection against unplanned disasters and failures in the business. When a server fails on a node or a whole node fails and there are backups, the failover clustering feature can redistribute the data and load balance the workload and other available servers. Server clustering is available for Microsoft windows server since 2003. Recently however it is also available on windows server 2016 and 2019 operating systems which are the most commonly used OS for servers today. </strong></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why I choose Server Clustering</span></h2>
<p style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 18px; padding: 12px; margin: px;" align="justify"><strong>I want to deliver the importance of how server clustering can help protect against disaster and failures in any business and any data centre if implemented. Creating a cluster of servers on a single network offers great protection and ensures the ultimate redundancy for an entire network and help prevent against any hardware problems or on-site outages that may occur. Clustering a server or a node of servers may have high-cost ramifications but the benefits you get from clustering them are worth it because according to articles on the internet in the wake of COVID-19 70% of organisations are now from home remotely. And having a cluster node of servers can help prevent data loss and be a high-available redundancy for businesses nowadays during these trying times. The primary role of a server cluster is for servers to work together on one system to provide users with higher availability. The problem server clustering helps solve is protection against outages and downtime, if one cluster experiences a service outage, that cluster&rsquo;s workload is redirected to another cluster of servers before the client experiences any downtime. Or if just one server in a cluster goes offline another server in that same cluster can take the workload and the client should not experience any downtime. In the future I believe it would be in my best interest to graduate from computing cloud and datacentre operations and further my experience in seeking employment in this sector of industry. </strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Technical Knowledge</span></h2>
<p style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 18px; padding: 11px; margin: px;" align="justify"><strong> My progress so far in the project I have wrote up a table of contents that will be the base on which I will follow to progress with my work during the year. I have also written up an abstract on what server clustering is and what my report will document along with advantages and disadvantages of server clustering. I will be discussing what exactly is clustering in servers and how it can help businesses and datacentres I will explain in detail how it is implemented and as well how costly this can be for the business. I will also answer why clustering instead of cloud database and in what scenario will clustering be utilized. Server clustering Disaster protection features include failover clustering service that is available since 2003 windows server operating system and is now used on 2016 windows server OS and 2019 windows server OS. And in detail how the algorithm Quorum is implemented and how it is selected with Dynamic Quorum witnesses and their different types and the different Quorum node types. I will also cover the events of hardware components failing and how that would affect the performance of server clusters and the three different types of clustering models and as well the big topic of high availability in clustering and how that works in clustered servers and what Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) do in server clustering. Additionally, I will cover the Oracle RAC and Microsoft services that come with high availability in server clustering. </strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Implementation</span></h2>
<p style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 18px; padding: 12px; margin: px;" align="justify"><strong>My plan for showcasing how server clustering works Is by implementing it in a virtual environment. I plan to progress with this in the 2nd semester and use what I have learned in the 1st semester of my project and in the theory, I have researched and learned so far, I will apply to a demonstrated virtual environment. My goal is to setup two different nodes of clustered servers using the failover clustering service in windows 2016 OS on the server manager panel and showcasing how it can help prevent disasters and what would happen if one cluster went down and how the workload would automatically be redistributed to the other cluster. That is my goal for implementing server clustering and show how this can help a real business and how it is better than a cloud-based infrastructure. </strong></p>
